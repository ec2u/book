# How To Name EC2U Web Sites

To create a coherent front to the ec2u alliance we should use a common url for every website or online services available
to public.

The alliance already have a main website : [http://ec2u.eu](http://ec2u.eu/) , and we can create as many sub domain as
needed (for example, the [http://card.ec2u.eu](http://card.ec2u.eu/)  ), the domain is currently managed by the IT
service in the university of Poitiers and so to add a new domain you can contact ??? with the wanted url and the IP
address of the website.

For easier usability, the name of website should be explicit, short and in English to make them easy to remember and
type.
